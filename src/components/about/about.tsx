              Hello, Iâ€™m Junita! I am a junior front end developer,
              currently studying at Medieinstitutet in Stockholm. As a
              former occupational therapist, I always have a creative
              perspective in mind and I love what innovation can do
              for people. Next up for me is an internship this autumn.
              I hope to find a place where I can contribute as well as
              learn and develop my front end skills. So if you're
              interested in talking more - don't hesitate to contact
              me!
