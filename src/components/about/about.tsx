              Hello, Iâ€™m Junita! A full stack developer driven by innovation and
              creativity. My experience from the game industry and insight into
              business strategy give me a broad view on technical challenges.
              With a background as an occupational therapist, I bring strong
              people skills, energy, and positivity that build successful teams.
              Combining analytical thinking with a sense of aesthetics, I create
              solutions that are both functional and visually appealing.
