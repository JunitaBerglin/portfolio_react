          Hello, Iâ€™m Junita! I am a junior front end developer,
          currently studying at Medieinstitutet in Stockholm. As a
          former occupational therapist, I always have a creative
          perspective in mind and I love what innovation can do for
          people. Next up for me is an internship this autumn. I hope
          to find a place where I can contribute as well as learn and
          develop my front end skills. So if you're interested in
          talking more - don't hesitate to contact me!
