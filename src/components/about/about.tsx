              Hello, Iâ€™m Junita! <br /> I am a full stack developer, with drive
              and passion for innovation, I combine a creative approach with
              technical skills, which I see as my strength. With lessons learned
              from the multifaceted game industry and with insight into both
              business strategies and company structures, I approach technical
              challenges with a broad perspective. My background as an
              occupational therapist has given me the ability to deal with all
              different types of people, and I contribute with a lot of energy
              and positivity which generates successful teams. This, together
              with my analytical skills and my sense of aesthetics, I deliver
              solutions that are not only functional but also thoughtful and
              visually appealing.
