            Hello, Iâ€™m Junita! I am a junior front end developer,
            currently studying at Medieinstitutet in Stockholm. As a
            former occupational therapist, I always have a creative
            perspective in mind and I love what innovation can do for
            people. Next up for me is an internship this autumn. I
            hope to find a place where I can contribute as well as
            learn and develop my front end skills. So if you're
            interested in talking more - don't hesitate to contact me!
          </p>
