              Hello, Iâ€™m Junita! Front end developer driven by a
              passion for innovation and a keen interest in AI, I
              combine a creative mindset with technical skills and
              believe that is my strength. With knowledge of the
              multifaceted gaming industry, my experiences enrich my
              approach to user-centered design. My occupational
              therapy background has given me strong social skills and
              contributes to a refined aesthetic sense, ensuring that
              I deliver not only functional but also visually engaging
              digital solutions. If you're interested in talking more
              - don't hesitate to contact me!
